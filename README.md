# Real-Time Human Movement Tracking using Digital Image Processing

## Overview
This project implements **real-time human movement tracking** using **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** and **Machine Learning**. The system processes live video streams, detects human movement, and tracks motion patterns for various applications such as security, sports analysis, and healthcare monitoring.

## Features
- **Real-Time Human Detection**: Detects humans in video frames using OpenCV and deep learning models.
- **Motion Tracking**: Tracks movement trajectories using optical flow and object tracking algorithms.
- **Pose Estimation**: Uses models like OpenPose for detailed skeletal tracking.
- **Live Video Processing**: Works with webcam and external camera feeds.
- **Alerts & Analysis**: Generates movement reports and anomaly detection alerts.

## Applications
- **Surveillance & Security**: Detects unauthorized movement in restricted areas.
- **Sports & Fitness**: Tracks athlete movements for performance analysis.
- **Healthcare**: Monitors patient movements to prevent falls.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Enables interaction through body gestures.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy**
